AUTONOMOUS CYCLES OF DATA ANALYSIS TASKS FOR INNOVATION PROCESSES IN MSMEs
Abstract
In this article, we propose the concept of ‘‘Autonomic Cycle for innovation processes’’, which defines a set of tasks of data analysis whose objective is to improve the innovation process in Micro-, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSMEs). The data analysis has become a fundamental area for the knowledge discovery from data extracted from different sources. In the autonomic cycle, each data analysis task interacts with each other and has different roles: some of them must observe the innovation process, others must analyze and interpret what happens in it, and finally, others make decisions in order to improve the innovation process. In this article, we identify three innovation sub-processes where can be applied autonomic cycles, which allow interoperating the actors of innovation processes (Data, People, Things, and Services). These autonomic cycles are one to define an innovation problem, another to specify innovation requirements, and finally, the last one to evaluate the results of the innovation process. Finally, we instance/apply the autonomic cycle of data analysis tasks to determine the innovation problem in the textile industry.
